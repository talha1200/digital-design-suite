# Explanation of Key Sections:

1. **Operand Comparison:**
	Determines which of the two operands is larger. This is needed for subtraction, as the order of operands matters for signed numbers.
	Mantissa and Exponent Alignment:

	The mantissas of the operands need to be aligned by adjusting the smaller operand's mantissa to match the larger operand's exponent. This is done by shifting the smaller operand's mantissa to the right.

2. **Addition Logic:**
	If the signs of the operands are the same, the mantissas are added together. If a carry occurs (i.e., the result has more bits than expected), the exponent is incremented.

3. **Subtraction Logic:**
	If the signs are different, the mantissa of the smaller operand is inverted and added to the larger one. This effectively performs subtraction.

4. **Normalization and Rounding:**
	The mantissas are adjusted so that they fit into the IEEE-754 format, and the result is normalized based on the final exponent and mantissa.

5. **Exception Handling:**
	If an exception occurs (e.g., one of the operands is Infinity or NaN), the result is set to zero and the exception flag is raised.
	This structure handles the core operations of IEEE-754 floating-point addition and subtraction efficiently, including normalization, rounding, and exception handling.
