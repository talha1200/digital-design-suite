# Explanation of Key Sections:

1. **Sign Calculation:**
	The sign of the result is calculated by XOR'ing the signs of the two operands. This ensures that the result is negative if the operands have different signs and positive if they have the same sign.

2. **Normalization of the Divisor:**
	The divisor is normalized by adjusting its exponent to 1022. This is necessary because division in floating-point arithmetic is generally performed by first normalizing the divisor to reduce computational complexity.
	A normalization shift is computed based on the exponent of operand B (the divisor), and this shift is used to adjust the exponent of operand A (the dividend) accordingly.
	### Step 1: Initial Multiplication:
		The first multiplication step uses the pre-calculated constant 64'hC00169695FFFFE00. This value was derived through extensive simulations and serves as a good initial approximation for the division operation.
		The normalized divisor is multiplied by this constant to generate an intermediate result, HalfWay_X0.
	
	### Step 2: Refinement using Addition and Subtraction:
		The intermediate result from Step 1 (HalfWay_X0) is refined using an addition-subtraction block.
		The constant 64'h40069696A0001333 is added to HalfWay_X0 to further improve the estimate for the division result. This value was also derived through simulations to achieve accurate results efficiently.
		The output of this stage, Iteration_X0, is the refined result.
	
	### Step 3: Final Multiplication:
		The final result is obtained by multiplying the refined estimate (Iteration_X0) with the normalized dividend (input1). This multiplication produces the final solution for the division.

3. **Result Concatenation:**

	After the final multiplication, the result is concatenated with the correct sign (which was calculated at the beginning).
	The result is then output if the floating-point ALU mode (fpalu_mode) indicates division (3'b011). Otherwise, the result is set to zero.

# How Multiplication and Addition-Subtraction are Used for Division:
	The division is performed using a method called Newton-Raphson iteration, a well-known technique for improving the accuracy of an initial estimate in numerical methods. Here's how it works:

	### Step 1 (Initial Guess):
		The first multiplication block uses a pre-calculated constant to get an initial guess for the reciprocal of the divisor. This is an approximation that helps speed up the convergence of the Newton-Raphson method.

	### Step 2 (Refinement via Add-Sub):
		The result from Step 1 is refined using an addition and subtraction step. This correction helps bring the estimate closer to the true result.
	
	### Step 3 (Final Refinement):
		The refined estimate from Step 2 is then multiplied by the dividend (operand A) to obtain the final division result.
