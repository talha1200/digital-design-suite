# Explanation of Key Sections:

1. **Sign Calculation:**
	The sign of the result is determined by the XOR of the signs of the operands. If the operands have the same sign, the result is positive; if they have opposite signs, the result is negative.

2. **Exception Handling:**
	An exception occurs if either operand has an exponent of all 1s, which indicates a special case like Infinity or NaN. The result is set to zero in these cases.

3. **Mantissa Assignment:**
	The mantissa of each operand is extracted, with the hidden bit (implicit bit) being 1 if the exponent is non-zero and 0 if the exponent is zero. This hidden bit is necessary for correct floating-point operations.

4. **Mantissa Multiplication:**
	The two mantissas are multiplied to get a 107-bit result, which provides enough precision for the subsequent normalization and rounding steps.

5. **Normalization:**
	If the product exceeds 53 bits, normalization is required. The product is shifted to the right by 1 bit, and the exponent is adjusted accordingly.

6. **Rounding:**
	The least significant bits are checked to see if rounding is necessary. The result is rounded by adding 1 to the least significant bit if any of the lower bits are set.

7. **Exponent Calculation:**
	The exponents of both operands are added together, and the bias value (1023) is subtracted to get the final exponent. The exponent is adjusted if normalization was required.

8. **Overflow and Underflow:**
	Overflow occurs if the exponent exceeds its maximum allowed value (1023). In this case, the result is set to Infinity.
	Underflow occurs if the exponent is too small (less than 1023 after bias correction). In this case, the result is set to zero.

9. **Result Assignment:**
	Based on the computed values, the final result is assembled from the sign, exponent, and mantissa. Special cases like exceptions, overflow, and underflow are handled appropriately.
